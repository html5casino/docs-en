# Upgrading from 2.9 to 3.x

This guide provides a gentle upgrade path for PhoneGap Build users who would like to upgrade from `2.9.0` to `3.x.x`.

## Architecture Changes

Many things have changed from `2.9.0` to `3.x.x`. There have been significant changes made to Cordova's architecture, these changes also apply to PhoneGap Build.

The core api's that were once bundled with every release (ex: contacts, camera, etc.) are now self contained plugins.

User's will now need to include features they would like to incorporate into their app.

For example, if a user's app relies on the contacts api they will need to include the following in their `config.xml`.

        <gap:plugin name="Contacts" value="org.apache.cordova.ContactManager" />

## How to Upgrade Your App

### Use a Config.xml

Add a `config.xml` to your application if you do not already have one. This file must reside in the root of your project, generally it's in the same directory as your `index.html`. For example:

        config.xml
        index.html
        imgs/
        js/
        css/
        res/

If you're unfamiliar with using a `config.xml` here is a simple template you can use. Copy and paste the following example into the `config.xml` file.

        <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>
        <widget xmlns = "http://www.w3.org/ns/widgets"

            xmlns:gap   = "http://phonegap.com/ns/1.0"
            id          = "com.phonegap.example"
            version     = "1.0.0"
            versionCode = "10" >

            <!-- versionCode is optional and Android only -->

            <preference name="phonegap-version" value="3.5.0" />

            <name>Sample Config.xml</name>

            Your Name
            </author>

        </widget>

It's recommended that you get familiar with using the config.xml. It improves the extensability of PhoneGap Build by allowing users to configure various aspects of the app such splash screens, icons, and plugins. You can view the documentation here: Configure Your App.

### Include Core APIs

Once you have a config.xml you will need to include all the core APIs required by your application.

To do so include a `<gap:plugin />` tag for each API, for example, if your app requires the device api include the following.

        <gap:plugin name="org.apache.cordova.device" />

If you fail to include an API your application may crash, we're currently working on making the experince as smooth as possible.

### Non-Core APIs

Like core apis, non-core plugins need to be added via a config.xml. For information related to non-core plugins please visit the <a href="https://build.phonegap.com/plugins" target="_blank">PhoneGap Build Plugins repo</a>.
