# Android Signing

[Generating a private key](#_generating_a_private_key)
[Submitting your key to build](#_submitting_your_key_to_build)
[Unlocking your key](#_unlocking_your_key)

**Note: it is Phonegap Build's policy not to retrieve signing keys for users, for legal reasons. Hold on to them.**

## Generating a private key

1. [Download and install Java](http://www.java.com/en/download/index.jsp).

2. Set Java_Home directory (http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19182-01/820-7851/inst_cli_jdk_javahome_t/index.html).

3. Open the command prompt (cmd.exe) as an Administrator, then Run the following command: `$ keytool -genkey -v -keystore [keystore_name].keystore -alias [alias_name] -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000`

4. Keytool will ask for keystore password. Enter password and confirm:
![Keystore Password](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-dTrBt9fr6XY/UQoYlRA-5AI/AAAAAAAAACA/HQfQ0dEeORE/s800/android_keystore_pass.png)

5. Next, keytool will ask for additional information. Supply appropriately:
![Keystore Password 2](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-tHJyFTz4Jgg/UQoZcBfALpI/AAAAAAAAACM/RadHnubtmzQ/s800/additional_info.png)

6. Next, keytool will ask password for Alias. Return if it's the same as keystore password. Othewise enter password and confirm:
![Alias password](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-rDuGcZs9D1o/UQobXI9BeqI/AAAAAAAAACk/Hzq0MRVysV4/s800/alias_password.png)

7. Your signing key is now ready to submit:

## Submitting your key to Build

![Edit signing keys](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-8yYhqgfxFd8/UQogUPNxBaI/AAAAAAAAADc/kS6zVSBT30U/s800/edit_account_settings.png)

Click 'add a key...', ensuring you use the same alias used when you generated your key.

## Unlocking your key
